\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this project is to assess the programming capabilities of a
junior developer. The project entails creating a Python package with file
operation and data analysis functionalities. The developer must also follow
proper version control and documentaion practices.

\section{Implementation}
The \verb|DataAnalysis| package is designed to be deployed as a pip package,
so that it can be downloaded and installed easily and publically. The package
functions are contained in the \verb|app| module, which is in the 
\verb|DataAnalysis| directory, along
with an \verb|__init__.py| file, which handles the imports for the package. In
the base directory there is also a \verb|setup.py| file that handles all the
functionality for the package being uploaded to PyPi.

\section{Challenges}
In the initial stages of the project, it was difficult to determine how the
package should be structured. Once I realised that the existence of a class
is unnecessary, the development process became simpler.
